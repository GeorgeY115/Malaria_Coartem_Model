################# EXTENDED COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS MODEL ####################

## This model establishes the burden of disease and mortality of a disease on a
## population divided into wealth quintiles. It allows for the implementation of
## a vaccine for which there is assumed life-long immunity.

## Read in data, which consists of, for each quintile, 5-year age groups, proportion
##Â of population in each age group, incidence, case fatality ratios, and the cost per
## case of treatment.
x <- read.csv("Model Test Data.csv")


## Establish size of total population and per-quintile population.
cohort_size <- 50000
q_cohort_size <- cohort_size/5


## Establish vaccine efficacy (assumed constant across Qs) and a vector with the
## coverages for each quintile. Multiply to get impact per quintile.
vaccine_efficacy <- 0.85
vaccine_coverage <- c(Q1=0.1,Q2=0.2,Q3=0.3,Q4=0.4,Q5=0.5)
vaccine_impact <- vaccine_efficacy*vaccine_coverage


## Establish life expectancy.
life_expectancy <- 90


## Establish the time frame (in years) over which the model will run.
timestep <- seq(0,50,by=1)


## Establish the disability weight used in the DALYs calculations.
disweight = 0.14


## Create vector which lists each quintile (simlpy 1-5). This is used for the outer
## loop, so results can be quintile-specific.
qunique <- unique(x$quintile)


## Create empty dataframe in which results will be stored.
outputtab <- data.frame(quintile=numeric(0),cases=numeric(0),deaths=numeric(0),
                        dalys=numeric(0),cost=numeric(0),postcases=numeric(0),

      ## partial immunity (according to the vax variable). If the programme began
      ## 8 years ago, for example, those 13 years old or younger will be vaccinated,
      ## so the <5 and 5-9 categories should have the full vax impact applied, the
      ## 10-14 category should have 80% of it applied, and any older age group should
      ## not yet experience any artificial immunity.
